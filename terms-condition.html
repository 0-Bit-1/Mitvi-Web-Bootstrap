You may be able to manage Updates to certain Content via Settings in MiTiVi. If it is determined, however, that the Update will fix a critical security vulnerability related to the Content, the Update may be completed irrespective of your Update settings in MiTiVi or your Device. If another app store attempts to update Content that was initially downloaded from MiTiVi, you may receive a warning or such updates may be prevented entirely.
<br />

<br />
Malware Protection. To protect you against malicious third party software, URLs, and other security issues, MiTiVi INDIA may receive information about your Device's network connections, potentially harmful URLs, the operating system, and apps installed on your Device through MiTiVi or from other sources.

You can choose to disable some of these protections in the settings on your Device, however, MiTiVi INDIA may continue to receive information about apps installed through MiTiVi, and apps installed on your Device from other sources may continue to be analyzed for security issues without sending information to MiTiVi INDIA.

<br />
Android Instant Apps. When you click on a link on your Device, MiTiVi may check if an applicable instant app exists and, if so, open the link within the instant app. Any code needed to run the portions of the instant app you access will be downloaded to your Device and kept on it temporarily. App details for an instant app can be found in the MiTiVi store. Android Instant Apps data and settings are synced to devices signed in with your MiTiVi INDIA account. You can choose to disable Android Instant Apps in the settings on your Device.
<br />
Changes to these Terms. If the Terms change, you will be given at least 30 days notice, and the new Terms will be effective after such notice period.

If you do not agree with such changes, you will be given the opportunity to download the Content you previously purchased or installed and terminate your use of the MiTiVi.

<h4>3. Purchases and Payments</h4>
<p>
Free Content. MiTiVi INDIA may allow you to download, view or use Content free of charge on MiTiVi. Additional limitations may apply to your access and use of certain free Content.
<br />
Purchase of Content. When you buy Content on or using MiTiVi you will enter into a separate sale contract based on these Terms (as applicable) with the seller which will be either:
(a) MiTiVi INDIA ; or<br />
(b) provider of the Content (the "Provider"), including where MiTiVi INDIA  is acting as an agent for the Provider.<br />
The separate sale contract is in addition to these Terms.
<br />
For sales where MiTiVi INDIA is acting as an agent for the Provider, the statement, in the MiTiVi INDIA ToS, that the MiTiVi INDIA ToS "do not create any third party beneficiary rights", does not apply to your use of MiTiVi.



<br />

Pre-orders. When you place a pre-order for Content, your contract for the purchase and use of that item is completed when the Content is made available to you, and you will be charged for the purchase at that time. You can cancel your pre-order at any time up to the point at which the Content becomes available to you. We will need to cancel your pre-order if the Content is withdrawn from sale through MiTiVi before it is made available and we reserve the right to cancel your order in the event the price changes before your order is fulfilled.
<br />
MiTiVi INDIA Payments. In order to purchase Content through MiTiVi, you must have a MiTiVi INDIA Payments account and agree to the MiTiVi INDIA Payments Terms of Service. The MiTiVi INDIA Payments Privacy Notice applies whenever you purchase Content using a MiTiVi INDIA Payments account. You are responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases made through MiTiVi on your MiTiVi INDIA Payments account.
<br />
Other Payment Processing Methods. MiTiVi INDIA may make available to you various payment processing methods in addition to MiTiVi INDIA Payments to facilitate the purchase of Content through MiTiVi. You must abide by any relevant terms and conditions or other legal agreement, whether with MiTiVi INDIA or a third party, that governs your use of a given payment processing method. MiTiVi INDIA may add or remove payment processing methods at its sole discretion. You are solely responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases you make on MiTiVi.
<br />
MITIVI INDIA will not be liable for any credit / debit card fraud. The liability for use of a card fraudulently will be on you and the onus to prove otherwise shall be exclusively on you. All information collected by us shall be governed as per our Privacy Policy. MITIVI INDIA will not be responsible for any transactions you make for using any portion of the Service(s). All claims and complaints for any failed or incorrect transactions must be directed to our payment processing partners and/or your bank (as the case may be).
<br />
Eligibility for Carrier Billing. In order to determine your eligibility to have purchases of Content that you make through your Devices billed to your network provider's account, when you create a MiTiVi account on a Device, we will send identifiers of your Device, e.g., subscriber ID and SIM card serial number, to your network provider. To permit this you will need to accept the network provider's terms of service. The network provider may send us your billing address information. We will hold and use this information in accordance with MiTiVi INDIA's Privacy Policies and MiTiVi INDIA Payments Privacy Notice.

<br />
Pricing. Pricing and availability of all Content displayed through MiTiVi are subject to change at any time prior to purchase.

<br />
Taxes. "Taxes" means any duties, customs fees, levies or taxes (other than income tax) associated with the sale of Content, including any related penalties or interest. You are responsible for any Taxes and must pay for Content without any reduction for Taxes. If the seller of Content or MiTiVi INDIA is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be charged to you. You must comply with any and all applicable tax laws, including the reporting and payment of any Taxes arising in connection with your use of MiTiVi or the purchase of Content on or through MiTiVi. The reporting and payment of any such applicable Taxes are your responsibility.

<br />

All Sales Final. See MiTiVi's Refund Policy for more information about your rights to withdraw, cancel, or return purchases for a refund. Except as expressly set out in MiTiVi's Refund Policies or the refund policies of the Provider, all sales are final, and no returns, replacements or refunds are permitted. If a replacement, return or refund is granted for any transaction, the transaction may be reversed, and you may no longer be able to access the Content that you acquired through that transaction.
<br />
Subscriptions. Subscriptions are automatically charged each billing period (whether weekly, monthly, annually, or another period), and you may be charged no more than 24 hours before the beginning of each billing period.
<br />
(a) Trials Periods. When you subscribe to Content for a price, you may receive access to the subscription benefits at no charge for a specified trial period, after which you will be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid being charged, you must cancel before the end of the trial period. Once you cancel your trial, you will immediately lose access to the relevant app and any subscription privileges unless otherwise specified. Access to such trial periods may be limited to a certain number of trials for each user during a given period, or other restrictions.
<br />
(b) Cancellations. You may cancel a subscription at any time before the end of the applicable billing period as described in the Help Center, and the cancellation will apply to the next period. For example, if you purchase a monthly subscription, you may cancel that subscription at any time during any month of the subscription, and the subscription will be cancelled as of the following month. You will not receive a refund for the current billing period, except as otherwise provided in MiTiVi's Refund Policy (for example where Content is defective). 

<br />
(c) Price Changes. When you purchase a subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. If the price of the subscription increases later, MiTiVi INDIA will notify you. The increase will apply to the next payment due from you after the notice, provided that you have been given at least 10 days' prior notice before the charge is made. If you are given less than 10 days' prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. If you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the subscription as described in the Cancellations section of these Terms, and you will not be charged further amounts for the subscription, provided you have notified us before the end of the current billing period. Where the Provider increases the price of a subscription and consent is required, MiTiVi INDIA may cancel your subscription unless you agree to the new price. If your subscription is cancelled and you later decide to re-subscribe, you will be charged at the then current subscription rate.
